    EMIRGE: Expectation-Maximization Iterative Reconstruction of Genes
            from the Environment

    EMIRGE reconstructs full length ribosomal genes from short read
    sequencing data.  In the process, it also provides estimates of the
    sequences' abundances.

    EMIRGE uses a modification of the EM algorithm to iterate between
    estimating the expected value of the abundance of all SSU sequences
    present in a sample and estimating the probabilities for each read
    that a specific sequence generated that read.  At the end of each
    iteration, those probabilities are used to re-calculate (correct) a
    consensus sequence for each reference SSU sequence, and the mapping is
    repeated, followed by the estimations of probabilities.  The
    iterations should usually stop when the reference sequences no longer
    change from one iteration to the next.  Practically, 40-80 iterations is
    usually sufficient for many samples.  Right now EMIRGE uses Bowtie
    alignments internally, though in theory a different mapper could be
    used.

    EMIRGE was designed for Illumina reads in FASTQ format, from pipeline
    version >= 1.3
